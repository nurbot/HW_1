1.Computer it’s an electric device which is made of hardware and contains software. It’s able to accept input of digital information compute it and give output on hardware device. 
 
2. Software it’s a set of instructions which are implemented in digital format for supporting and running any computer operation or program.
 
3. Computer programs exists to perform some specific task. They can be explicit or not. Computer programs are written in computer language and run by machine code.
 
4. Programing language it’s a collection of data and specific symbols created to help create some different kind of programs. There are 2 types of them: Imperative and Declarative.
 
5. Programing Paradigms is the way how we write our program. Depends on complexity and hardware we can choose one of 3 paradigms to program. Procedural, Functional or Object-Oriented Programming paradigm.
 
6. There are 4 principals of OOP which is Abstraction, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and   Inheritance. These principles are the core of OOP.
 
7. Abstraction has an Abstract class which help to extend other classes with particular state and behavior. To avoid a lot of changes in different fields in many classes we can just change it in this Abstract class. But usually it has a constant value.
 
       8.   Polymorphism allows an object to choose the right form through other methods or fields with a same name but with a different state and behavior. 
 
        9. Inheritance is an ability of object to take properties of another object(parent) or give it to child(object).
       
        10.  Encapsulation is a technique to hide some important data (fields and methods) from public access by giving them private access modifier. When it’s private it can be open only within a class.
            
         11.  Class it’s a prototype of an object with the specific behavior and state. For example, we can take an iPhone and it will be the object of class “phone”. It has some common behavior and state.
 
         12.  Object it’s an instance of the class it can contain state or behavior. They have their own signatures. Objects which are participated in program store in RAM. In Java we have a garbage collector which helps us to clean the memory from no longer referenced objects.
